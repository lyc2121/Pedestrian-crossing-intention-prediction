# Pedestrian-crossing-intention-prediction
This is a video demonstration showcasing the use of our model to predict pedestrian crossing intentions.
In this demo video, we predict pedestrian crossing intentions by comparing the bounding box provided by the dataset with the bounding box predicted by the YOLOV5S-DeepSort model.
